### Exercise 1
```{r, Ex1}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -faculty_type, names_to = "year") %>%
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value))

staff_long

staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = year,
    y = value,
    group = faculty_type,
    color = faculty_type
  )) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.1) + 
  labs(
    title = "Trends in Instructional Staff Employment"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```


```{r, Ex,highlight how part-time faculty increase over time}
# then, I will show that the proportion of part-time faculty have gone up over time compared to other instructional staff types.
# to do that, I would need to highlight how part-time faculty increase over time, I would need to made their line thicker. 

staff_long %>%
  mutate(highlight = if_else(faculty_type == "Part-Time Faculty", "Part-Time Faculty", "Other")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = year,
    y = value,
    group = faculty_type,
    color = highlight,
    alpha = highlight,
    linewidth = highlight
  )) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Part-Time Faculty" = "red", "Other" = "black")) +
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c("Part-Time Faculty" = 1, "Other" = 0.4)) +
  scale_linewidth_manual(values = c("Part-Time Faculty" = 1.5, "Other" = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Increase in Part-Time Faculty Employment",
    x = "Year",
    y = "value",
    color = "Faculty Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() 
# In a ggplot2 tutorial, I found out how to make one of my lines different from the others. the link is here: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/0.9.1/topics/scale_colour_manual.


```


### Exercise 2
```{r,Fisheries}
# maybe we can use horizontal bar charts for easier comparison and clarity. 

fisheries <- read_csv("data/fisheries.csv")
fisheries

fisheries_data <- fisheries %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(capture, aquaculture),
               names_to = "Type",
               values_to = "Tonnage")
fisheries_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(country, Tonnage), y = Tonnage, fill = Type)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Fishery Production by Country",
       x = "country",
       y = "Total Tonnage (tons)",
       fill = "Production Type") +
  theme_minimal()
# Nah... the above method made my bar charts all aggregated and it's impossible to see how each country is distributed.
# maybe I need to try a different plot.
# Nah, still not working, they all aggregated together. I may need to filter out the top country. I use top 15 countries. 

top15_fisheries <- fisheries %>%
  mutate(total = capture + aquaculture) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>% 
  slice_head(n = 15) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(capture, aquaculture),
               names_to = "type",
               values_to = "production")
# the above calculate my top 15 countries. 

top15_fisheries %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = production, y = fct_reorder(country, production), fill = type)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 15 Countries by Fishery Production",
    x = "Production (tons)",
    y = "Country",
    fill = "Production Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

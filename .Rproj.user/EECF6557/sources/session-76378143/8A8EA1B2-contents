### Exercise 1
```{r, Ex1}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -faculty_type, names_to = "year") %>%
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value))

staff_long

staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = year,
    y = value,
    group = faculty_type,
    color = faculty_type
  )) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.1) + 
  labs(
    title = "Trends in Instructional Staff Employment"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```


```{r, Ex,highlight how part-time faculty increase over time}
# then, I will show that the proportion of part-time faculty have gone up over time compared to other instructional staff types.
# to do that, I would need to highlight how part-time faculty increase over time, I would need to made their line thicker. 

staff_long %>%
  mutate(highlight = if_else(faculty_type == "Part-Time Faculty", "Part-Time Faculty", "Other")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = year,
    y = value,
    group = faculty_type,
    color = highlight,
    alpha = highlight,
    linewidth = highlight
  )) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Part-Time Faculty" = "red", "Other" = "black")) +
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c("Part-Time Faculty" = 1, "Other" = 0.4)) +
  scale_linewidth_manual(values = c("Part-Time Faculty" = 1.5, "Other" = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Increase in Part-Time Faculty Employment",
    x = "Year",
    y = "value",
    color = "Faculty Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() 
# In a ggplot2 tutorial, I found out how to make one of my lines different from the others. the link is here: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/0.9.1/topics/scale_colour_manual.
